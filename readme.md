# Jokes-CLI - A Basic CLI Made with Golang
This application is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) built with Golang and the Cobra CLI framework. It's designed to retrieve and deliver random jokes from a JSON file containing a collection of jokes. Although the intention is to fetch random jokes from an external API, this functionality has not been implemented as of now.

## Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/): The Go programming language.
